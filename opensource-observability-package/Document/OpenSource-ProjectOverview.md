# Kubernetes Observability Stack - Project Overview

## Project Summary

The Kubernetes Observability Stack is a comprehensive monitoring solution that provides visibility into applications, infrastructure, and services. Built with open-source technologies, it offers monitoring, logging, and tracing capabilities for Kubernetes environments.

### Key Features

- **Open Source**: No vendor lock-in or licensing costs
- **Self-hosted**: Complete control over your data
- **Kubernetes-native**: Designed specifically for Kubernetes deployments
- **Complete observability**: Metrics, logs, and traces in one platform

## System Architecture

### Components

**Core Observability (4 services):**
- **Prometheus**: Metrics collection and storage
- **Grafana**: Dashboards and visualization
- **Loki**: Log aggregation and storage
- **Promtail**: Log collection agent

**Infrastructure Monitoring:**
- **Node Exporter**: Host system metrics
- **cAdvisor**: Container metrics
- **kube-state-metrics**: Kubernetes object metrics
- **Blackbox Exporter**: Endpoint monitoring

**Additional Services:**
- **Tempo**: Distributed tracing
- **Smokeping**: Network latency monitoring
- **MTR**: Network path analysis
- **Database Exporters**: MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Redis monitoring

## Data Flow

The observability stack follows a standard data collection and aggregation pattern:

1. **Metrics Collection**: Prometheus scrapes metrics from exporters
2. **Log Collection**: Promtail collects logs from pods and sends to Loki
3. **Trace Collection**: Applications send traces to Tempo
4. **Visualization**: Grafana queries all data sources for dashboards and alerts

## Use Cases

**Infrastructure Monitoring:**
- CPU, memory, and disk usage tracking
- Container and pod resource monitoring
- Network performance monitoring

**Application Monitoring:**
- Request tracing and latency monitoring
- Error rate and response time tracking
- Database performance monitoring

**Log Management:**
- Centralized log collection and storage
- Log correlation with metrics and traces
- Error pattern detection

**Alerting:**
- Resource threshold alerts
- Service availability monitoring
- Performance anomaly detection
